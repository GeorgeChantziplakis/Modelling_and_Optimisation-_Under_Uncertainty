# Modelling_and_Optimisation-_Under_Uncertainty

Academic Project

In the first task, the objective was to examine and analyze the behavior of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on COVID-19 Tweets published between December 2020 and April 2021. The aim was to gain insights into the topics categorized by the tweets and to expand our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19. The paper explains and demonstrates the application of topic modeling techniques to categorize tweets by subject and to gain a better understanding of the vaccine through a positive or negative sense. The study concluded that Latent Dirichlet Allocation was the superior unsupervised technique for categorizing the text in 12 topics. 

In the second task, the objective was to develop a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) and suggest an optimization technique for controlling and regulating the environment, climate, and irrigation of a commercial greenhouse. The paper describes the input variables for the greenhouse, which were built on internal and external factors such as temperature, lighting, PH, humidity, soil moisture content, and cloudiness. The fuzzy logic controller simulation was created in MATLAB using the fuzzy logic toolbox. Furthermore, the paper explains the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and how it works to obtain the most optimal set of rules for our controller. Additionally, the differences between Mamdani and Sugeno models are presented. Finally, two optimization techniques, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization, were compared using two functions from the CECâ€™2005 suite of benchmark functions.
